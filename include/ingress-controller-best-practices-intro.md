!!! info "Other recommendations"
    Wallarm’s version of the Kubernetes Ingress controller is based on the [community-supported NGINX Ingress controller for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx), so the majority of recommendations found in the official Ingress controller documentation and on the public Internet are also applicable to Wallarm’s Ingress controller.
