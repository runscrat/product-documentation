Configure your environment to mirror incoming traffic to an instance with the Wallarm node you are deploying. For configuration details, we recommend to refer to documentation on the solution you are going to use to produce the traffic mirror (web server, proxy server, etc.).

Inside the [link][web-server-mirroring-examples], you will find the example configuration for NGINX, Traefik, Envoy.
