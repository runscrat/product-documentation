Among all supported [Wallarm deployment options][deployment-platform-docs], AMI is recommended for Wallarm deployment in these **use cases**:

* Your existing infrastructure resides on AWS.
* You aim to deploy a security solution as a virtual appliance using a virtual machine image.
* You prefer not to install a security solution directly on your frontend, such as NGINX, and instead wish to establish it as a standalone instance or a group of instances.
