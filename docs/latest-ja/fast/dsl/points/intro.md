This document describes the principles you need to consider when creating points for FAST DSL (domain-specific language) extensions. The section consists of the following subsections:
* The [Basic Concepts][link-basics] subsection gives the definition of the term “point” and describes the role of points in FAST extension creation.
* The [Parsers and Filters][link-parsers] subsection provides detailed information about the data you can extract from the request for further processing.
* The [Points Building Principles][link-principles] subsection describes the rules you need to follow while building points for FAST DSL extensions.
* The [How to Build a Point][link-construction] subsection provides step-by-step examples of the points-building process using the knowledge acquired from the previous subsections.
