Among all supported [Wallarm deployment options][deployment-platform-docs], AMI is recommended for Wallarm deployment in these **use cases**:

1. Your existing infrastructure resides on AWS. In this case, using Wallarm AMI for deploying a Wallarm node is a natural extension.
1. You aim to deploy a security solution as a virtual appliance using a virtual machine image.
1. You leverage a simplified deployment process. With AMI, you launch a pre-configured server image, that makes the deployment process both faster and more reliable.
